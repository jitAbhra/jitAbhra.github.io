I would like to thank [purecss.io](Purecss.io) for their free css and layouts. All of them are simply amazing and professional. Special thanks to John Donahue for [gfm.css](https://github.com/johnmdonahue/git_marked), which I have customised.
One should not forget to thank Fletcher T. Penney for his amazing [multimarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4)
