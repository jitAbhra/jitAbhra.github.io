# Blogs

## Project 26
**Project 26** is about write a blog every fortnight about related scientific topics during a period of one year. The topics can be diverse in nature, numerical techniques, Solving special class of problems, comparison, benchmarking, some new cool softwares.   

## Discussions
 This is to take a leaf out from our constant effort to run a discussion group. The blogs under this section should be accessible and informal in nature.

## github and others
 The aim behind this is to build up together. I will add more as I proceed.
