 I am a final year PhD student at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.imsc.res.in). During my graduate studies, I have been trying to understand soft-matter physics near and far from equilibrium under supervision of [Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari]() using theoretical modelling, analytical computation and numerical simulations.


Before joining [The Institute of Mathematical Science](www.imsc.res.in) as a research scholar, I had completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) with Physics major from [Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira](http://www.vidyamandira.ac.in/) affiliated by [Calcutta University](http://www.caluniv.ac.in/). Details about my career can be found in my [CV](cv.pdf).
