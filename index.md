 I am in final year PhD student at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.imsc.res.in). During my graduate studies, I have been trying to understand soft-matter physics near equilibrium and in far from equilibrium under supervision of [Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari]().


Before joining [Institute of Mathematical Science](www.imsc.res.in) as a research scholar, I had completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) with Physics major from [R.K.M.Vidyamandira](http://www.vidyamandira.ac.in/) affiliated by [Calcutta University](http://www.caluniv.ac.in/). Details about my career can be found in my [CV](cv.pdf).
