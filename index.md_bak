Hello, I am Abhrajit Laskar. I am pursuing for a PhD in theoretical soft-condensed matter physics under supervision of [Dr. Ronojoy Adhikari](http://rjoy.in/group/) at The Institute of Mathematical Science, commonly known as [IMSc](http://www.imsc.res.in),Chennai. Visit our [active soft matter group](http://rjoy.in/group/) for more information.

### Research Interest

My primary research interest is to understand emergent collective behaviour of active soft-matter systems. By the term *soft-matter systems*, I mean systems which are made of bodies, which are deformable in nature with high elastic coefficients and these particles are *active* as they constantly input mechanical energy by transduction from its environment. For example, in a bacterial colony, each and every living bacterium swims and tumbles around, by taking energy from the environment through the nutrients intake. Their motions, input **kinetic energy** constantly in the system. Similarly, catalytic nano-motors propel in chemical solution by transforming chemical energy to mechanical motion. 

In recent experiments, researchers around the world found very rich and counterintuitive phenomenas in those active systems. They are ubiquitous in nature. One of the most charming of these phenomenas is in spite being far from equilibrium, they show systematic collective phenomenas in a very noisy environment. It helps them extra swimming speed, exploring more environment and thus give them advantage for survival as a group rather than an individual one. Our effort is to understand these systems, so we can have a control over such systems.    

 We use Statistical Mechanics tools to understand these experiments and try to reproduce these phenomenas in-silico by modeling gross features of constituent masses and their time dependent motion. In-silico experiments are numerically heavy. Feel free to drop a mail about our works on these systems.

 Lastly, I am also very much interested in Classical Statistical Mechanics, Non-equilibrium counter part of it, other soft-matter systems, hydrodynamic theories, effect of noise and lastly liquid crystals and defects.

### Teaching and Discussion

Though I do not have much experience about teaching, I do believe with time I will find this quality in me. We, [Rajesh](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/) and me run a couple of discussion groups in [IMSc](www.imsc.res.in) with focus on algorithm in one and theoretical soft-matter in the other one. 

### Resume

Before joining [IMSc](www.imsc.res.in) as a research scholar, I had done my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Physics major from [R.K.M.Vidyamandira](http://www.vidyamandira.ac.in/) under Calcutta University, commonly known as [C.U](http://www.caluniv.ac.in/). Timeline and expertises of my career are given [here](cv.pdf). If my expertises are needed, feel free to drop me a mail, given in [contacts](contacts.html)
