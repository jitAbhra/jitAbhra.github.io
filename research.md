# Research & Publication!

So far during my graduate days, I have spent some time to understand active matter systems, specially, filaments made of active particles in a viscous medium. A single filament or polymer is modeled by attaching active monomers by well-established polymer potentials given in literature. They represent semi-flexible passive filaments with the absence of chemo-mechanical activity of the constituent particles. But **activity** of the constituent monomers make the difference. Active monomers can generate complicated **long-ranged** velocity field in a viscous medium. Now unlike in non-viscid thin medium, where inertia plays dominant role screening long-range nature of the velocity field, they can communicate among themselves through viscid medium. In these two works, we have found and managed to understand nice and cool motions mimicking reminiscent of systematic bio-movements of flagella and cilia.
